Specter is useful for navigating through nested data structures, and then returning (selecting) or transforming what it finds. Specter can also work its magic **recursively**. Many of Specter's most important and powerful use cases in your codebase will require you to use Specter's recursive features. However, just as recursion can be difficult to grok at first, using Specter recursively can be challenging. This guide is designed to help you feel at home using Specter recursively.
